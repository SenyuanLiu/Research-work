#Welcome! These are research I have completed during my time at UCSB. I have posted them to give potential employers a quick insight on my coding skills and knowledge.

- The Visualized Color Quantization by K-means in Processing and Its Performance in Machine Learning: 

   Images will be processed using color quantization algorithm based on K-Means in RGB and K-means in HSB to reduce the number of colors in the image, realized in Processing 4.0.3. Implemented three methods that compare image similarity in python to compare the performance of RGB and HSB. Used Res-Net18 image classification machine learning model to test the performance of K-means in color quantization by comparing the training time and training results. This project uses Natural_Image Dataset from Kaggle. 

- Equity return & GBM & URB:

   Elaborated the properties by applying different statistical models: Geometric Brownian Motion and Ehrenfest URN. Improved and modified URN model. Focused on the following properties: distributional properties, tail properties and extreme fluctuations, path-wise regularity, linear and nonlinear dependence of returns in time and across stocks.

- GBM & Stock price

   Explained the fundamental mathematical and statistical theories applied in the simulation of stock volatility. Involved the introduction to geometric Brownian motion, stochastic process, random walk, and some important statistical theorems.
